&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to document the journey of bringing our software project,
LA JUNGLE, to market and achieving feature completeness. It’s been a challenging
yet rewarding process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LA JUNGLE is a software application aimed at simplifying project management for
creative teams. From the initial concept to development and testing, it’s been
an exciting journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;development-process&quot;&gt;Development Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We followed an agile development process, breaking down the project into
manageable tasks and iterations. Regular feedback from users and stakeholders
helped us refine our features and prioritize our roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges-faced&quot;&gt;Challenges Faced&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the development process, we faced various challenges, from technical
hurdles to resource constraints. However, our team remained resilient and
focused on our goal of delivering a high-quality product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to share my journey and learnings from doing part-time
service and coding work. It’s been an interesting experience balancing my
studies and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started doing part-time service and coding work during my college years. It
was a great way to apply what I was learning in class to real-world projects and
earn some extra income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges-faced&quot;&gt;Challenges Faced&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was rewarding, there were also challenges. Balancing coursework with
client deadlines required careful time management and prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-learnings&quot;&gt;Key Learnings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this experience, I learned valuable skills such as communication,
problem-solving, and project management. It also helped me build a portfolio of
work that I could showcase to potential employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, my experience with part-time service and coding work has been
incredibly valuable. It provided me with practical experience, skills, and a
network that have helped me in my career journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="current-works" /><category term="part-time" /><category term="coding" /><category term="experience" /><category term="freelancing" /><summary type="html">Sharing my journey and learnings from doing part-time service and coding work.</summary></entry></feed>
