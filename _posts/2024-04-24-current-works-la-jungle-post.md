# LA JUNGLE - Going to Market and Getting Feature Complete

## Introduction

LA JUNGLE is an international marketplace app designed to uplift the African diaspora through international trade and exchange. Our mission is to create a seamless and vibrant platform that connects users with local businesses, enabling the exchange of goods and services across borders. As we approach the final stages of development, we're excited to share our journey towards achieving feature completeness and preparing for market launch.

## Development Process

Our development process has been guided by a clear vision and a user-centric approach. We started with a proof of concept that includes essential features such as:

- **Home Page**: Displays nearby restaurants, making it easy for users to discover local dining options.
- **Account Page**: Allows users to view and manage their favorited items.
- **Account Setup**: Provides a straightforward process for users to create and customize their profiles.

These initial features laid the groundwork for our app, providing a solid foundation upon which to build more complex functionalities.

## Challenges Faced

Developing LA JUNGLE has not been without its challenges. Some of the key obstacles we've encountered include:

- **Integration of Diverse Technologies**: Balancing the integration of React, Tailwind, GraphQL, Google Maps API on the frontend with Rails and Devise authentication on the backend required careful planning and execution.
- **Scalability Concerns**: Ensuring that our platform can handle a growing user base and expanding features was a critical consideration.
- **User Experience**: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that caters to an international audience posed its own set of challenges.

Despite these hurdles, our team has remained committed to overcoming each obstacle, continually iterating on our design and implementation strategies.

## Achieving Feature Completeness

As we near the 80% completion mark, we are focused on expanding our feature set to include:

- **Marketplace by Location**: Users can browse and shop for items based on their geographical location.
- **Posting Listings**: Sellers can post their own listings, facilitating a vibrant marketplace.
- **Delivery and Shipping Options**: Users can opt for local delivery or receive shipping suggestions for their purchases.
- **Internal Admin Panel**: This tool will allow us to test growth hypotheses and measure ROI, ensuring we are meeting our business goals.

Our tech stack choices have been pivotal in our development journey. We selected mature technologies known for their scalability and robustness:

- **Frontend**: Built with React, Tailwind, GraphQL, and Google Maps API for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Rails for model and controller APIs, GraphQL for efficient data queries, and Devise for secure user authentication.

These technologies provide a stable and flexible environment that supports our current needs and future growth.

## Conclusion

The journey to bring LA JUNGLE to market has been both challenging and rewarding. As we finalize the remaining features and prepare for user onboarding, we are excited about the impact our platform will have on the African diaspora and international trade. Our commitment to creating a seamless, user-friendly marketplace app remains unwavering, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead.

Stay tuned for more updates as we approach our launch date and begin welcoming users to the LA JUNGLE community.
